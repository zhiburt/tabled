//! This module contains a [`Rotate`] primitive which can be used in order to rotate [`Table`].
//!
//! It's also possible to transpose the table at the point of construction.
//! See [`Builder::index`].
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use tabled::{Table, settings::Rotate};
//!
//! let data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]];
//!
//! let table = Table::new(data).with(Rotate::Left).to_string();
//!
//! assert_eq!(
//!     table,
//!     concat!(
//!         "+---+---+---+\n",
//!         "| 2 | 3 | 6 |\n",
//!         "+---+---+---+\n",
//!         "| 1 | 2 | 5 |\n",
//!         "+---+---+---+\n",
//!         "| 0 | 1 | 4 |\n",
//!         "+---+---+---+",
//!     )
//! );
//! ```
